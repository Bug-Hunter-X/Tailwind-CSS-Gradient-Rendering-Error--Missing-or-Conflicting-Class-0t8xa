# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to Tailwind CSS gradients where the gradient might not render correctly due to a missing or conflicting class definition in the Tailwind configuration file.

The problem stems from the use of gradient classes like `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500`. If the `to-purple-500` class (or any class in the gradient definition) is missing or conflicting, the gradient might not render as expected.  This is different from typical syntax errors because it won't immediately show a console error. The element may only show one color or no gradient at all.

**Solution:** Verify your Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or equivalent) to ensure that the classes are correctly defined.  Also, check for any plugin conflicts that might be overriding your gradient classes.  Ensure that you've correctly run the Tailwind build process to generate the required CSS files.
