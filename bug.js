```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <p>This is some text with a gradient background</p>
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS gradient classes.  However, if the `to-purple-500` class doesn't exist in your Tailwind config file (perhaps due to a typo or an incomplete purge process) or if there is a conflict with a plugin, this may result in unexpected styling or rendering errors.  The gradient might not display correctly, or the element might look completely different than expected, potentially showing only one color from the gradient or no gradient at all.  The error might not be immediately obvious, as it might not produce a JavaScript error in the console.
